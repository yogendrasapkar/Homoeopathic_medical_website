<h1>Treatment:</h1>
<p>Homoeopathic doctors work in the same way as conventional doctors do. History taking, examination and investigation are all important in establishing the diagnosis. However, as well as asking about your symptoms, a homoeopathic doctor will be interested in you as an individual and the unique way in which your symptoms affect you.Homoeopathic doctors work in the same way as conventional doctors do.

Homoeopathy is a medical system based on the belief that the body can cure itself. Those who practice it use tiny amounts of natural substances, like plants and minerals. They believe these stimulate the healing process.</p>
<h2>The homoeopathic consultation</h2>
<img  class="image" src="dr.jpg"><p>Questions about your lifestyle, eating habits and preferences, temperament, personality, sleep patterns and medical history help the doctor to form a complete picture of you. This picture will be matched to the symptoms of your illness in order to prescribe a particular type and strength of homoeopathic medicine.<br><br>As a guide your first appointment could take anything up to an hour, with follow-up appointments typically lasting 30 minutes. This does vary depending on the practitioner and the setting in which they work.</p><br><br>
<h2>How Does It Work?</h2>
<p>A basic belief behind homoeopathy is “like cures like.” In other words, something that brings on symptoms in a healthy person can -- in a very small dose -- treat an illness with similar symptoms. This is meant to trigger the body’s natural defenses.<br>For example, red onion makes your eyes water. That’s why it’s used in homoeopathic remedies for allergies. Treatments for other ailments are made from poison ivy, white arsenic, crushed whole bees, and an herb called arnica.<br>Homoeopathic doctors (who also are called “homoeopaths”) weaken these ingredients by adding water or alcohol. Then they shake the mixture as part of a process called “potentization.” They believe this step transfers the healing essence. Homoeopaths also believe that the lower the dose, the more powerful the medicine. In fact, many of these remedies no longer contain any molecules of the original substance. They come in a variety of forms, like sugar pellets, liquid drops, creams, gels, and tablets.</p>
<h2>The medicine:</h2>
<p>At the end of the consultation your homoeopathic doctor will give you a prescription and advise you how often to take the medicine. Homoeopathy is usually taken in tablet or pillule form, but is also available in liquid and powder form. Homoeopathic gels or cream may also be prescribed for some conditions.</p>
