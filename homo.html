<h1>What is homoeopathy help ?</h1>
<p class="margin">Homoeopathy is a natural form of medicine used by over 200 million people worldwide to treat both acute and chronic conditions. It is based on the principle of ‘like cures like’. In other words, a substance taken in small amounts will cure the same symptoms it causes if taken in large amounts.</p>
<p> <img class="what" src="what.jpg"> Homoeopathy is a safe, gentle, and natural system of healing that works with your body to relieve symptoms, restore itself, and improve your overall health. It is extremely safe to use, even with very small children and pets, has none of the side effects of many traditional medications, is very affordable, is made from natural substances, and is FDA regulated.</p>
<p class="margin">It is used to treat acute illnesses, like colds, ear infections, migraines, and sore throats, as well as chronic conditions, like asthma, depression, autism, and arthritis.<br>Homoeopathic medicines – known as “remedies” – are made from natural sources (e.g., plants, minerals), and are environmentally friendly and cruelty free. Most are available over the counter in grocery stores, drug stores, health food stores, homoeopathic pharmacies, and online. They are also extremely affordable. Homoeopathic remedies when used as directed, are completely safe for everyone – including pregnant and nursing women, infants, children, and adults. They are given in such small doses that they don’t cause side effects.<br><br>One thing to note is that the word homoeopathy is not a general or “umbrella” term that describes a variety of different natural therapies. Although homoeopathic remedies are derived from natural substances, homoeopathy should not be confused with herbal medicine, Chinese medicine, or other types of natural medicines. It is its own, unique therapeutic system. </p>
<p><b>Anyone can learn to treat simple conditions safely at home using homoeopathy, but a professional should treat serious or life-threatening conditions.</b></p>
