  	<h1> WHY HOMOEOPATHY</h1>
   <h3><p><i> Homoeopathy is presently the 2nd largest system of medicine in the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). It was discovered by a German scientist Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in 1796, and has been verified clinically for 200 years. Homoeopathy treatment is natural, safe, gentle and effective. In India, over 100 million people depend on homoeopathy for health issues.</i></p></h3>

<h2 style="color:black;font-size: 30px;">The First Principle:  Let Likes Cure Likes</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 10px;">
The guiding principle of Homoeopathy is stated as “let likes cure likes,” similia similibus curentur.  While the concept of "like curing like" dates back to the Greek Father of Medicine, Hippocrates (460-377 B.C.), it was German physician Dr. C. F. Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843) who first codified this principle into a system of medicine.  Starting with experiments (called “provings”) on himself,  Dr. Hahnemann administered medicinal substances to healthy volunteers (called “provers”).  Symptoms that developed in the provers while taking a specific substance gave the homoeopathic “picture” of, and indications for, that remedy.  Over the years, by means of provings, toxicological data, and clinical experience, the homoeopathic drug pictures of over 2000 substances have been derived.<br>
In the practice of Homoeopathic Medicine, a detailed, comprehensive interview of the patient, called the homoeopathic case-taking, is undertaken to reveal the physical, psychological and emotional characteristics and complaints of that individual.  The homoeopathic practitioner then finds the homoeopathic remedy whose materia medica (drug picture) is the most similar to that of the patient’s characteristic totality.  That homoeopathic prescription (the similimum) is given to the patient to stimulate his/her being to heal:  likes cures likes.</p>
<h2 style="color:black;font-size: 30px;">The Second Principle:  The Minimum Dose</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 10px;">
The second principle of Homoeopathy is that of the minimum dose.  Dr. Hahnemann began using medicinal substances known to work in his day, such as Cinchona or Peruvian bark, for relapsing fever, in a homoeopathic way. That means that he administered a medicament with a known remedy picture to a sick person who had a similar symptom picture.  But, in the beginning, he was using crude substances, for example, full strength herbs.  He observed that, while the patients got well, they also had side effects.  To minimize those side effects, through further experimentation, he came upon the idea of potentization.  Homoeopathic medicines are prepared through a series of dilutions, at each step of which there is a vigorous agitation of the solution called succussion, until there is no detectible chemical substance left.  As paradoxical as it may seem, the higher the dilution, when prepared in this dynamized way, the more potent the homoeopathic remedy.  Thereby is achieved the minimum dose which, none the less, has the maximum therapeutic effect with the fewest side effects.  In fact, Homoeopathy has an enviable centuries old history of safety in use of its potentized oral medicines among patients of all ages, including babies, children, pregnant and nursing women, and senior citizens.</p>


<h2 style="color:black;font-size: 30px;">The Third Principle:  The Single Remedy</h2>
<p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 10px;">
The third principle of Homoeopathy is the single remedy.  Most homoeopathic practitioners prescribe one remedy at a time.  The homoeopathic remedy has been proved by itself, producing its own unique drug picture.  That remedy is matched (prescribed) to the sick person having a similar picture.  The results are observed, uncluttered by the confusion of effects that might be produced if more than one medicine were given at the same time. </p> 
<h2 style="color:black;font-size: 30px;">About homoeopathic treatment:  Acute and Chronic</h2>

<p style="font-size: 20px;margin-left: 10px;">
There are two main categories of treatment in Homoeopathic Medicine; i.e., acute and chronic.  Acute treatment is for illness of recent onset; it may be self-limited (for example, the common cold), or it may progress if not treated (for example, pneumonia).  In such an illness the body might overcome the illness, a cold for example, sooner or later, but the appropriate medicine gently stimulates the body to recover more quickly and efficiently.  <br>

Chronic or constitutional treatment is the other main category of treatment.  A chronic disease is long standing or a recurrent health problem.  The length of treatment and the challenge to achieve positive results is affected by many factors, including the nature of the problem, the early health history, the family medical history, the previous treatment, and the person’s inherent constitutional strength.  The goal is to help the person to return to a state of well-being through individualized homoeopathic treatment. </P>
